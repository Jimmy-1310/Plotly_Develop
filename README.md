# Plotly

For this project I was tasked with the creation of an interactive dashboard that could showcase and represent the data of each ID. First I created an HTML file to make it visually appealing, then I created a javascript document to create the visualizations and interactive features of the page. With the help of javascript, the user is now able to acces the page and filter the desired ID to showcase. After selecting the ID, a bar graph, a bubble graph and a gauger graph were created to explain the data the ID contained.

For this project I used HTML syntax to develop the page, D3 to create eventlisteners and plotly to create the desired graphs.

For the costumization part I added an image to the jumbotron and also changed the color of the letters in order to make them visible in the images. I also made the page mobile-responsive
